# FloodDepthDL
State-of-the-art DL models can be designed to effectively learn spatiotemporal nonlinear associations between flood dynamics and the underlying drivers, processes, and site characteristics. Here, we present a coupled DL model that predicts flood extent and inundation depth in Galveston Bay, TX by combining the spatial feature extraction capabilities of Convolutional Neural Networks with the temporal nonlinear regression capabilities of Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTM). The Convolutional LSTM model assimilates multimodal data features including forcing drivers, site-specific characteristics, and compound flood maps generated with a calibrated coastal hydrodynamic model.
